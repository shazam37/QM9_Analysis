# QM9_Analysis

QM9 is a dataset containing quantum chemical properties (at DFT level) for a relevant, consistent, and comprehensive chemical space of small organic molecules. The database serves as the benchmarking of existing machine learning methods, development of new such methods, such as hybrid quantum mechanics/machine learning, and systematic identification of structure-property relationships.

The dataset contains 134000 molecules with up to 9 heavy atoms.
